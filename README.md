<h1>Create a WebServer Setup on Kubernetes using the Dynamic Slave Node of Jenkins.</h1>

<h3>Steps :</h3>
<ol>
<li>
1. Create a Dockerfile having SSH and Kubectl configured
  </li>
  <li>
2. Configure the Docker server so that Jenkins Docker Plugin can communicate
  </li>
  <li>
3. Use the created Dockerfile as the Dynamic Node Template, which can be used by specifying certain labels
  </li>
  <li>
4. Create another Dockerfile which acts as a webserver image for the Kubernetes Pods
  </li>
  <li>
5. Create Deployment/ RollOut Update to the Kubernetes using the Dynamic Slave.
  </li>
A) If launching first time then create a deployment of the pod using the image created in the previous job. Else if deployment already exists then do roll-out of the existing pod making zero downtime for the user.

B) If Application created first time, then Expose the application. Else donâ€™t expose it.
</ol>

<h3>Solution :</h3>
Create an Image from the Dockerfile having Kubectl configuration file in it, which can be used as a template for creating dynamic slave node.
